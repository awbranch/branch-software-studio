Branch Software Studio along with [Good Talk Consulting](https://www.goodtalkforall.com/) and [Clare Smythe Design LLC](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clare-smythe-06446813/) are working to help the [West Side Campaign Against Hunger](https://www.wscah.org/) (WSCAH) redesign their website to better showcase WSCAH's mission to put dignity, community, and choice at the heart of food distribution in NYC.

The new website will feature a thoughtfully redesigned website with a modern and user-centric design that embodies the WSCAH mission of dignity, community, and choice.

- **Customers** will find the services WSCAH provides and understand how to get the food they need quickly.
- **Volunteers** will understand why they are needed and how they can help.
- **Donors** will understand the impact WSCAH is making and how their donation helps WSCAH meet the community's needs.
