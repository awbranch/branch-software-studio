The site was rebuilt from the ground up with the following goals in mind:

- **CUSTOMER-CENTRIC**: Focus on solving specific problems for customers, volunteers and donors.
- **MEASURABLE IMPACT**: Develop metrics and goals to understand how the new site is helping SPK.
- **MODERN DESIGN**: Update the website style to be clean, simple, accessible, and easy to navigate.
- **MAINTAINABLE**: Allow the SPK staff to easily maintain and update the site with new content.
- **SUSTAINABLE**: Keep ongoing costs, support, and maintenance to a minimum.
