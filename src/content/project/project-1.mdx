The portal allows users to review and compare performance data of their local criminal justice system broken down by defendant and case characteristics such as race, sex, and offense severity."

As the Measures for Justice Director of Technology, I built a team of engineers and designers from 2015 to 2020 to conceptualize and deliver the National Data Portal. This project was a huge undertaking by a small team of engineers and researchers who believed in an idea that everyone else said was impossible.

Our hard work resulted in coverage in [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/opinion/missing-criminal-justice-data.html), [The Marshall Project](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2017/05/23/the-new-tool-that-could-revolutionize-how-we-measure-justice), [Salon](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/06/how-data-can-help-reform-our-criminal-justice-system/) and [many others](https://measuresforjustice.org/mfj-news-types/mfj-in-the-news/) and established Measures for Justice as the leader in the criminal justice transparency space.

  It’s a sad reality that in today’s America there is no easy way to access the
  most basic criminal justice data from across the country. Better access to
  criminal justice data is important for informing efforts to make our
  communities safer and our criminal justice system fairer—after all, you can’t
  solve a problem if you don’t have the facts. We’re thrilled to be supporting
  Measures for Justice’s work.
