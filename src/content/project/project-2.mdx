I served as the Director of Product Engineering during the Measures for Justice [Commons](https://measuresforjustice.org/what-we-do/solutions/commons) development, leading a team of engineers and designers through all stages of engineering and delivery. Our first deployment was for the [Yolo County](https://app.measuresforjustice.org/commons/yoloda), California's District Attornies office in April 2021, which was well received in [The Sacramento Bee](https://measuresforjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SacramentoCAShouldAdoptYoloCountyRacialBiasReformTheSacramentoBee.pdf) and [local news](https://www.dailydemocrat.com/2021/04/07/yolo-county-da-launches-all-inclusive-data-center/).

Let's use this transparency and open data to facilitate new conversations and drive the best possible outcomes for the people of our community."

Commons is freely accessible to the community, giving them unprecedented data and insights into their local prosecutorial system.

Commons allows the community to work with their local district attorney to set and track agreed-upon policy goals. Yolo County set and met a goal to increase felony-level diversions (alternatives to incarceration) to 10% of all felonies by 2022.

The data can be easily broken down by defendant characteristics, such as race, to ensure people are treated equally for the same offenses.

The following video details how Commons was received by the community and how it is helping the prosecutor's office better understand its own data and set and meet goals important to the community.
